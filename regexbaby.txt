Open your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way <knowing the truth.

The mind which is created quick to love, is responsive to everything that is pleasing, soon as by pleasure it is awakened into activity. Your apprehensive faculty draws an impression from a real object, and unfolds it within you, so that it makes the mind turn thereto.

Tune up your circuits, check out your Chips

Because you're going to live a Long Life.
Check the identity card, it shows your code.

Listen to the white noise in your ears - it Fades AWAY.

Watching the sunset on the end of the HIGHWAY --- 
City meditation in curving reflections of NEON signs on the Chrome of the Cars.
The WeT Concrete and mirrored Streets recall shows the traffic away, 
recalls you to the smell of scratching cloudy sheets.
Billboards and Cholo-Ads above are the unfocused bottle of Time.
Drink it away, FLY to the ORBITAL Fly.
Away to drivin' the ocean of blue-green.
Drivin' away to the ocean of green-blue.
